# The Project

Now, your project `workshop-pipeline` contains a YAML file `azure-pipelines.yml`. This file describes how our project will be build.

:::tip
In case of troubles editing YAML file, you can refer to the [YAML schema reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=azure-devops&tabs=schema%2Cparameter-schema)
:::

Letâ€™s a take a look at it:

```yaml
# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- master

pool:
 vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- script: echo Hello, world!
  displayName: 'Run a one-line script'

- script: |
   echo Add other tasks to build, test, and deploy your project.
   echo See https://aka.ms/yaml
 displayName: 'Run a multi-line script'
```

Pipeline will be trigger by listening on master branch changes. It will be run on a Microsoft-hosted agent with an Ubuntu Operating System. According to the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops#capabilities-and-limitations), Microsoft-hosted agent are [Standard_DS2_v2 machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dv2-dsv2-series#dsv2-series) on Microsoft Azure.
Finally, our pipeline has 1 stage, one 1 job containing two script tasks.

:::tip
Microsoft-hosted agents are Standard_DS2_v2 machines with 2 vCPU, 7G RAM and  14G of SSD disk capabilities

The project is divided into two applications. The `backend` directory contains a simple Java / Maven application and the `frontend` directory contains a simple Express Js application.

As we are going to edit `azure-pipelines.yml`, a simple text editor could be enough. However, there is an extension [Azure Pipelines](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azure-devops.azure-pipelines) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It adds syntax highlighting and autocompletion for Azure Pipelines YAML.
