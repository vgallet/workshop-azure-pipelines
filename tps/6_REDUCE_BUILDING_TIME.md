# Reduce Building Time

## Caching Maven dependencies

Backend job and Frontend job can be run in parallel, it helps to reduce building time. 
Nevertheless, backend and frontend jobs have to download needed dependencies at each build. Itâ€™s possible to use a cache mechanism to avoid downloading those libraries each time.

This mechanism is documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/caching?view=azure-devops).

Warning, the right task to use is `CacheBeta@1` in Azure Pipelines YAML file.

## Caching Node dependencies

You can use the same mechanism to cache the `node_modules` directory.
