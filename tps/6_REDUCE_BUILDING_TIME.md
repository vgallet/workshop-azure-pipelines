# Reduce Building Time

## Caching Maven dependencies

As building backend and building frontend are two distinct jobs, they can be run in parallel is a good point to minimize building time.

Nevertheless, backend and frontend jobs have to download needed dependencies at each build. Itâ€™s possible to use a cache mechanism to avoid downloading those libraries each time.

This mechanism is documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/caching?view=azure-devops).

Warning, the right task to use is `CacheBeta@1` in Azure Pipelines YAML file.

## Caching Node dependencies

You can use the same mechanism to cache the `node_modules` directory.
