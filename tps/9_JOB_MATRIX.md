# Job Matrix

Your team wants to migrate its Backend application from Java 8 to Java 11. However, the team wants to be sure that the project still works with JDK 8 and JDK 11.

One way to do that is to duplicate the Backend building job and change the JDK version. But it does not follow the DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principle and it increases the amount of code to maintain.

Another way is to use [Job Matrix feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=azure-devops&tabs=schema%2Cparameter-schema#matrix).

Create a matrix to the Backend job.

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    JDK11:
      JAVA_VERSION: '1.11'
    JDK8:
      JAVA_VERSION: '1.8'

```

Then, you can use the variable `JAVA_VERSION` in the Maven task.
